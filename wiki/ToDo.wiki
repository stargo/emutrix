Crossed-out entries are implemented features. Probably subject to a lot of change, but most features are feasible up to version 1.0. Comment below or post an issue if you want a particular feature implemented.
==Pre-release==
  * ~~GUI~~
  * ~~Basic routing~~
  * ~~Master level~~
  * ~~Basic panic button~~
  * ~~Output attenuation PADs~~
==v0.1 <font color="red">current</font>==
  * ~~Sane/safe initial settings~~
  * ~~Card selection~~
  * ~~Read initial ALSA element values~~
  * ~~Callbacks to react to outside changes~~ ~~(pads don't work yet, alsa lib or driver bug?)~~ Works now, was a driver bug, now fixed. Implemented a workaround in the meanwhile.
==v0.2 <font color="green">in svn</font>==
  * "Link" feature (L and R channels go together)
  * ~~Move ALSA code to its own class~~
  * ~~View settings (hiding unavailable channels)~~
  * Change names of 1010 devices to 1010/Dock if available
==v0.3==
  * Support for full hardware resolution fader.
  * Make mute toggle (clicking it again reverts to original setting)
  * Useful panic feature (temporarily mute all channels)
  * 0404 PCI support
==v0.4==
  * Session management (storage of element values) using LASH(?)
  * Tray icon
==v0.5==
  * User manual
  * Stabilizing
  * Testing with different cards

  * Automatize changing card clock rate settings according to jack setup
==v0.7==
  * External clock rate
  * ~~Fix input Pads~~
==v0.8==
  * Nicer icons (that make sense)
  * Make matrix look nicer, easier to navigate (e.g highlight channel names on hover)

  * Fancier GUI stuff (Tooltips, dB displays, etc.)
  * Level monitoring
==v1.0==
  * User manual
  * Stabilizing
  * Testing with different cards
==v1.1+==
Very speculative, may involve driver modification.
  * Multichannel routing with levels ("sends")
  * Effects
  * Hardware level monitoring
  * Autodetect card model
  * Control dock LEDs ("lock")
  * S/MUX for higher clock rates (88.2, 96 kHz)
  * S/MUX for highest clock rates (176.4, 192 kHz)
  * MIDI control
